    <b>Content</b>: knowledge graph construction for intelligent maintenance
        <li>The research project intends to extract knowledge and data from large number of non-structured power plant maintenance  report and build knowledge graph based on relation between knowledge entities.</li>
        <li>We manually labeled part of maintenance report and did some experiment by applying Bi-LSTM-Lattice  model to extract knowledge. Currently we have a relatively good result with applying lattice model on named  entity extraction.</li>
        <li>We proposed a framework to build knowledge graph for power plant and our paper gets published on conference ICEBE 2019, and we are awarded as Best Paper of conference.</li>
